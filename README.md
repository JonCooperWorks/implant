Cloak and Dagger Implementation
===============================

Implant is an implementation of the Android Clock and Dagger vulnerability.
To learn more about Cloak and Dagger see, http://cloak-and-dagger.org.

If the overlays do not display correctly on your phone, adjust the overlay dimensions in the relevant Stage subclasses.
Currently only the AccessibilityStage of the attack uses Android side channels to determine the position of elements on screen.

Pull requests and criticism accepted.

TODO
====
+ Make the overlays dynamically resize based on screen size
+ Implement all attacks described in the paper
